# Make MLOps Easy Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Make MLOps Easy**, an AI-powered framework that streamlines the entire machine learning operations lifecycle. The project encapsulates data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and observability into a simple, reusable pipeline.

## Highlights

- Automated data preprocessing with support for CSV, JSON, and Parquet inputs.
- Intelligent training that detects the task type and selects appropriate estimators.
- Turnkey deployment with artifact preservation and optional endpoint scaffolding.
- Observability features that track metrics and predictions over time.
- A friendly CLI (`make-mlops-easy`) plus Docker support for reproducible runs.

## Audience

These docs target:

- **Data scientists** who want a batteries-included MLOps workflow.
- **MLOps engineers** seeking an extensible baseline pipeline.
- **Developers** contributing to or integrating with Make MLOps Easy.

Use the navigation to jump into quick start guides, CLI reference material, pipeline internals, or development workflows.
